                    A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a <dfn>specialized electronic circuit</dfn> designed to rapidly manipulate 
                    and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display 
                    device. GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.
                    The leading brands for GPU's these days are from <big>Nvidia and from AMD</big>. &reg;

                    <cite>Nvidia's GeForce graphics processing units &trade;</cite>, 17 iterations in, 
                    is a top tier brand of graphics for <s><i>high margin PC gaming</i></s>. GeForce GPUs are very dominant 
                    in the general-purpose graphics processor unit (GPGPU) market thanks to their 
                    proprietary CUDA architecture. GPGPU is expected to expand GPU functionality 
                    beyond the traditional rasterization of 3D graphics, to turn it into a <em>high-performance</em> ++---
                    computing device able to execute arbitrary programming code in the same way a CPU does, 
                    but with different strengths (highly parallel execution of straightforward calculations) 
                    and weaknesses (worse performance for complex branching code). &euro;

                    The "GeForce" name originated from a contest held by Nvidia in <mark>early 1999</mark> called "Name That Chip". 
                    The company called out to the public to name the successor to the RIVA TNT2 line of graphics boards.
                    The latest GeForce 30 series was officially announced at the GeForce Special Event that the successor 
                    to GeForce 20 series will be the 30 series. The GeForce Special Event introduced took place on September 
                    1, 2020 and set September 17 as the official release date for the 3080 GPU, September 24 as the release 
                    date for the 3090 GPU and October for the 3070 GPU. &uarr; &darr;
