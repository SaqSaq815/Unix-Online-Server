                    A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a <dfn>specialized electronic circuit</dfn> designed to rapidly manipulate 
                    and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display 
                    device. GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.
                    The leading brands for GPU's these days are from <big>Nvidia and from AMD</big>. &reg;

                    <h2>Nvidia Graphics Processing Units</h2>
                    <p>
                        <cite>Nvidia's GeForce graphics processing units &trade;</cite>, 17 iterations in, 
                        is a top tier brand of graphics for <s><i>high margin PC gaming</i></s>. GeForce GPUs are very dominant 
                        in the general-purpose graphics processor unit (GPGPU) market thanks to their 
                        proprietary CUDA architecture. GPGPU is expected to expand GPU functionality 
                        beyond the traditional rasterization of 3D graphics, to turn it into a <em>high-performance</em> ++---
                        computing device able to execute arbitrary programming code in the same way a CPU does, 
                        but with different strengths (highly parallel execution of straightforward calculations) 
                        and weaknesses (worse performance for complex branching code). &euro;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The "GeForce" name originated from a contest held by Nvidia in <mark>early 1999</mark> called "Name That Chip". 
                        The company called out to the public to name the successor to the RIVA TNT2 line of graphics boards.
                        The latest GeForce 30 series was officially announced at the GeForce Special Event that the successor 
                        to GeForce 20 series will be the 30 series. The GeForce Special Event introduced took place on September 
                        1, 2020 and set September 17 as the official release date for the 3080 GPU, September 24 as the release 
                        date for the 3090 GPU and October for the 3070 GPU. &uarr; &darr;

                    <h2>AMD Radeon Graphics Processing Units</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Radeon RX 6000 series</strong> is a series of graphics processing 
                        units developed by AMD, based on their RDNA 2 architecture. It was <b>announced 
                        on October 28</b>, 2020 and is the successor to the Radeon RX 5000 series. The lineup 
                        consists of the RX 6500 XT, RX 6600, RX 6600 XT, RX 6700 XT, RX 6800, RX 6800 XT and RX 6900 
                        XT for desktop computers, and the RX 6600M, RX 6700M, and RX 6800M for laptops.&clubs;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The brand was previously only <cite>known as "ATI Radeon"</cite> until August 2010, when it was renamed to increase 
                        AMD's brand awareness on a global scale. Products up to and including the HD 5000 series are branded 
                        as ATI Radeon, while the HD 6000 series and beyond use the new AMD Radeon branding. &Delta;
