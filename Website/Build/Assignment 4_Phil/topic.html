                <p>
                    Our brand was first launched by Philip Rieck, a young entrepreneur seeking to make the world a greater
                    place for the communities. He first started on February 2022 in his parent’s garage, his parents didn’t
                    approve nor supported him in his journey. But once he started to get revenue, his parents started to
                    believe in his stupidities and help him through his journey.

            <h2>Why We Started?</h2>
            <section id="topicBody1">
                <p>
                    We started to make the lives of our clients more accessible and easier than before by inventing and
                    releasing products to facilitate their daily lives. These products range from many different
                    difficulties or situations that Philip has encountered in his life and knows that other people out
                    there have the same issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, he also hates to do to repetitive tasks, so he likes to make machines or inventions to
                    do it for him or use products to hide the issues away. He discussed his ideas with several hundred
                    people, and they all agreed to him, so that’s why he started his journey. These products are also
                    made from recycled material which helps our planet.
                </p>
